	abstract = {This book is an elegant and rigorous presentation of integer programming, exposing the subjects mathematical depth and broad applicability. Special attention is given to the theory behind the algorithms used in state-of-the-art solvers. An abundance of concrete examples and exercises of both theoretical and real-world interest explore the wide range of applications and ramifications of the theory. Each chapter is accompanied by an expertly informed guide to the literature and special topics, rounding out the readers understanding and serving as a gateway to deeper study.Key topics include:formulationspolyhedral theorycutting planesdecompositionenumerationsemidefinite relaxationsWritten by renowned experts in integer programming and combinatorial optimization, Integer Programming is destined to become an essential text in the field.},
